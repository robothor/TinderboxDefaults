TinderboxDefaults
=================

These are the xml files that I set in the app, customized to my personal needs.

Changes that I've made here:
- colors.xml: removed the default colors and added the solarized colors
- menus.xml: removed the default layout and added the solarized colors, grouped into the dark, light and accent color groups
- html_helpers.xml: added Sublime Text 2 as a helper

These need to be installed into `~Library/Application Support/Tinderbox/`.
